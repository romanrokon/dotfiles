# Sentry for AI

Your AI coding assistant already knows how to write code. This plugin teaches it Sentry — how to set it up, how to find and fix production issues, and how to get the most out of every feature.

Whether you're adding Sentry to a new project, debugging a spike in errors, or configuring alerts, just ask. The plugin gives your assistant the context it needs to do it right.

Supports **Claude Code** and **Cursor**.

## What You Can Do

**Set up Sentry in any project** — SDK setup wizards that detect your stack, recommend the right features, and walk through the full installation. No copy-pasting from docs.

```
Add Sentry to my Next.js app
Set up Sentry in my Rails project
Add error monitoring to my iOS app
```

**Find and fix production issues** — Query your Sentry environment, triage errors, and fix them in place.

```
/seer What are the top errors in the last 24 hours?
/seer Which issues are affecting the most users?
Fix the recent Sentry errors
```

**Review code with Sentry context** — Automatically resolve bugs that Sentry or Seer flag in pull request comments.

```
Review PR #118 and fix the Sentry comments
```

**Configure monitoring** — Set up alerts, instrument AI/LLM calls, connect OpenTelemetry pipelines.

```
Create a Slack alert for new high-priority issues
Monitor my OpenAI calls with Sentry
Set up OTel Collector with Sentry exporter
```

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/install-plugin sentry
```

Restart Claude Code to activate, then verify:

```bash
/help           # Should show /seer command
/mcp            # Should show sentry MCP server
```

### Cursor

Search for **Sentry** in Cursor Settings > Plugins and install.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-for-ai.git

# Claude Code
/install-plugin file:///path/to/sentry-for-ai

# Cursor
ln -s /path/to/sentry-for-ai ~/.cursor/plugins/local/sentry-for-ai
```

## Prerequisites

The plugin configures the [Sentry MCP server](https://mcp.sentry.dev) automatically on install. No extra setup needed.

Some workflow skills require the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
brew install gh    # macOS
gh auth login
```

## Contributing

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. SDK bundles include a `references/` directory for feature-specific deep dives.

Use the `sentry-sdk-skill-creator` skill to scaffold new SDK bundles — it handles research, writing, and validation.
