# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
Sentry plugin for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor). Provides MCP server integration, slash commands, and skills.

## Commit Attribution
AI commits MUST include:
```
Co-Authored-By: (the agent model's name and attribution byline)
```

## Plugin Structure
```
commands/               # Slash commands (/seer)
skills/                 # Setup and review skills
.agents/                # Symlinks to commands/ and skills/
.claude-plugin/         # Claude Code plugin metadata
.cursor-plugin/         # Cursor plugin metadata
```

Skills use YAML frontmatter with `allowed-tools` — this is required by Cursor and harmless in Claude Code. Keep it in all skill files.

## MCP Server
Sentry MCP server configured at `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp`. Two config files exist:
- `.mcp.json` — Claude Code format
- `mcp.json` — Cursor format

## Key Conventions
- All setup skills must **detect platform/SDK before suggesting configuration** — never assume
- Sentry code review skill only processes comments from `sentry[bot]`, ignores other bots
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) required for PR-related skills
- Avoid emojis in skill/command content — keep output platform-neutral

## Skill Tree Navigation

**How it works:**
- 3 router skills (always visible in agent metadata): `sentry-sdk-setup`, `sentry-workflow`, `sentry-feature-setup`
- All other skills are hidden with `disable-model-invocation: true` — loaded on-demand when a router points to them
- `SKILL_TREE.md` at repo root is the flat sitemap listing every skill
- This keeps startup metadata at ~300 tokens instead of ~1,600+ as the library grows
- Tools that don't support `disable-model-invocation` simply see all skills (same as before)

**Categories:**
- `sdk-setup` — platform/language SDK setup wizards (router: `sentry-sdk-setup`)
- `workflow` — debugging, code review, issue management (router: `sentry-workflow`)
- `feature-setup` — specific feature configuration (router: `sentry-feature-setup`)
- `internal` — contributor tools, no router

**Adding a new skill:**
1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with standard frontmatter
2. Add `category`, `parent`, `disable-model-invocation: true` to frontmatter
3. Add breadcrumb as first body line: `> [All Skills](../../SKILL_TREE.md) > [Category](../router/SKILL.md) > Skill Name`
4. Add the skill to the parent router's routing table
5. Run `scripts/build-skill-tree.sh` to regenerate `SKILL_TREE.md` and validate
6. CI validates automatically on every PR

**Adding a new category:**
- When a category exceeds ~10 skills, consider splitting
- Create a new router skill with `role: router` in frontmatter
- Update existing skills' `category` and `parent` fields
- Update this file to document the new category

**Validation:**
- `scripts/build-skill-tree.sh` — regenerates `SKILL_TREE.md`, validates all frontmatter, breadcrumbs, and router tables
- `scripts/build-skill-tree.sh --check` — CI mode, fails if `SKILL_TREE.md` is stale or validation errors exist
